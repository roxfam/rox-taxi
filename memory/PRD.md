# Rox Taxi Service & Tours — PRD

## Product Vision
A production-grade website for a Bahamian taxi + tours + car-rental business (Nassau & Paradise Island focus) with pre-booking, online payments, admin panel, and complete guest-lifecycle automations (SMS, email, cron jobs, referrals, tips, driver spotlights, real Google reviews).

## Core Requirements
- Booking flow (taxi, tours, rentals) with dynamic pricing (per-person, add-ons, taxi add-ons, referral discounts, tips)
- Stripe (BYOK via `STRIPE_API_KEY`), PayPal, Zelle payment paths
- Twilio SMS + SMTP email pipeline for every guest touch-point
- Admin console: catalog CRUD, bookings, deposits, notifications, reviews, referrals, deliverability, weekly reports
- Post-trip tip top-up flow (SMS 15 min after completion) + weekly owner report email
- Emergent Object Storage (no local disk uploads)
- Google Places API 4+ star reviews auto-sync (cron hourly)
- Driver tracking / QR check-in + Admin Audit Heatmap
- Referral system with 10% discount + admin leaderboard

## Personas
- **Owner** — reviews bookings, deliverability, and weekly performance from `/admin`; gets SMS + email pings for every meaningful site event.
- **Guest** — books taxi/tour/rental, receives SMS+email lifecycle nudges, tips post-trip.
- **Driver** — reads day-of manifest, scans QR at pickup.

## CHANGELOG

### Feb 2026 — Owner SMS fan-out (multi-recipient)
- **Two owner cellphones now ping on every event** — `ADMIN_SMS_NUMBER` is now comma-separated (`+12424322587,+12424285524`). New `send_owner_sms(body)` helper in `notifications.py` fans out to every recipient; returns a per-number delivery report.
- **All owner SMS paths refactored** to use the helper: `notify_owner_activity`, `notify_owner_booking_created`, `notify_owner_payment_received`, contact form, tip top-up, group inquiry, gallery submission, referral conversion, signup.
- **Verified live**: direct test sent to both numbers, both `sent: true`.

### Feb 2026 — Deliverability alerts + weekly report preview + full owner activity SMS
- **Owner Activity SMS (Feb 2026)** — Owner cellphone at `+12424322587` now pings on every meaningful site event:
  - New customer signup (auth.py register hook)
  - Referral conversion (server.py `_apply_referral_conversion_if_paid`)
  - Group inquiry (server.py `/group-inquiries`)
  - New guest photo submission (`routes/gallery.py`)
  - Contact form (already wired)
  - Tip top-up submitted (already wired)
  - New booking + payment received (already wired)
  All routed through `notifications.notify_owner_activity(kind, sms_body, ...)` — fire-and-forget, never blocks user response.
- **Weekly Report Preview** — `GET /api/admin/analytics/weekly-report/preview` returns the exact HTML that ships in the Monday email. Frontend "Preview email" button on `WeeklyReportCard` fetches with admin bearer and opens in a new tab via Blob URL.
- **Delivery Alert Thresholds** — Owner alert when SMS or email failure rate exceeds threshold (default 5%) in rolling 24h.
  - New endpoint `GET /api/admin/analytics/delivery-health?hours=24`
  - New endpoint `PUT /api/admin/analytics/delivery-health/threshold` (editable %)
  - New cron `POST /api/cron/check-delivery-alerts` — hourly, throttled to 1 alert per 6h per breach
  - Frontend "Armed / Over threshold" chip + inline threshold editor + "Test alert" button on WeeklyReportCard
- **Storage-backed Image List** — Mongo `uploaded_images` collection powers `/api/admin/images`.
- **Tip Bump SMS live-verified** — Twilio delivered to +12424322587.

### Cron schedule (`.emergent/crons.yml`)
- `sync-google-reviews` — hourly
- `send-tip-bump-sms` — every 5 min
- `send-weekly-report` — Monday 9am UTC
- `check-delivery-alerts` — hourly at :15

### Previous work carried over
- Reagan Itinerary Builder (14 stops, pick 7 for $235)
- Refer-a-Friend system with 10% discount + admin leaderboard
- Twilio SMS + SMTP email pipeline (booking, tip bump, return-leg, rental return, photo share)
- Google Reviews auto-sync (4+ stars, hourly) with Claude-drafted replies
- Emergent Object Storage migration for all uploads

---

## ROADMAP

### P0
- Confirm live SMS pipeline on production URL (Twilio verified; user should test one live signup).
- **Apple Login** — BLOCKED, needs user's Apple Developer account.

### P1
- Refresh hero slides (Atlantis, Rose Island, Junkanoo) with proprietary photos.
- SMS quiet-hours: suppress owner activity SMS between 10pm-7am Nassau time and batch into a morning digest (deferred — user opted for firehose).
- Admin filter on booking table: "failed deliverability last 24h".

### P2
- Referral card locator timeout in test suite.
- server.py refactor — continue splitting logic into `/app/backend/routes/`.
